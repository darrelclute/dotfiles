Dotfiles
========

This is a collection of dotfiles for customizing the shell and various
utilities on UNIX like systems.  Management of the dotfiles is handled by a
quickly hacked together script in cmds/bin/dotfiles which wraps `GNU Stow`_.
This will likely be replaced by `bookkeeper` in the future when more time can
be invested into this.
